# Meteor PDF Tutorial

This is a little tutorial that I put together to help Meteorites with generating PDF reports from data they've collected in their Meteor apps. You can find the tutorial [here](http://ryanswapp.com/).

At the beginning of the tutorial we set up the app. If you'd like to skip straight to the PDF section you can clone this repo and navigate to the ```start``` folder. This is were the PDF section begins.
